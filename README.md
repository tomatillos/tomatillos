ML engineer focused on maximising FLOPs.

Particular interests:
- Automating GPU kernel generation with smarter compilers and/or llms.
- Hardware-informed architectures

Projects:
- [loopfuse](https://github.com/tomatillos/loopfuse): Triton kernel code generation, can fuse attention kernels from scratch.
- [serve](https://github.com/tomatillos/serve): Minimal llm inference engine written in Triton + `torch.compile`
